                    Filler text about how I haven't had a chicken nugget in over 8 years. I don't know, they just don't taste all that good to me. Like, their flavor is essentially just the flavor of the breading. That, and the fact that I once found a feather in my chicken nugget really make it seem pretty unappetizing.

                    I am filling this area with text as well so that I can just fill this area until workable code is entered. So, I guess I'll try to come up with a random long paragraph so I can check the scroll function of the modal in this web app. For some reason all I can think about right now that could use some explanation is PCR testing. It's become so mainstream to talk about PCR testing because of COVID, but I remember using it to genotype lab specimens in college. PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction and it is a method of increasing the sample DNA for testing. There are two reagents involved in PCR testing: the polymerase solution and the primers. While I'm not 100% sure how they work, I do know that it required hours of pipetting a week. And I can still remember the smell of a fresh slab of agarose gel straight from the lab microwave. Which was surprisingly not horrible. I still have nightmares about those days, literally months of my time spent slightly underground in a world of sterile off-white lab equipment, with the smell of disinfectant and bleach permeating the air. I suppose it was a cool experience working in a lab, but I wouldn't say that it was a fun one.
